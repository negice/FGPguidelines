Using the swiper plugin, you are able to view relationships between layers or see what is underneath a layer with a simple swipe. The swiper plugin can be utilized in just a few quick steps so you can start comparing layers. Swipe to compare layers The most ideal use case for the Swiper plugin is to compare two (or more) layers. This can be useful to view before and after imagery or to view similarities and differences between datasets in the same area. To create a comparison between layers, the layers are both added to the map and the comparison layer is identified. A seamless comparison awaits.

Each section is proportional to the quantity it represents. A pie chart contains a single series of data points. The pie charts are used to show part-to-whole relationships or for data composition. Pie charts are not intended for comparing individual sections with each other or representing exact values ( it is recommended that a serial chart should be used instead). Pie charts are also not meant to show more than five to eight data points. Doughnut plot The Plugin is capable of using implementing an alternative representation of the common pie chart commonly known as the doughnut plot. A doughnut plot (aka donut plot) is simply a pie chart with a central circle removed. For the most part, there aren\u2019t significant differences in readability between a pie chart and donut chart, so the choice of a doughnut over a standard circle is mostly that of aesthetic. One small boon for the ring shape is that the central area can be used for additional information or to report statistics. Best Practices Tips for interacting with the Pie Charts Keep the followin in mind when using a Pie Chart to visualize data: Don\u2019t use more than five sections It is reccomended that around 5 sections is an adequate amount of slices to be used with the pie charts. Too many slices are hard to read. It is easy to overwhelm the user. Make sure all data adds up to 100% Verify that values total 100% and that pie slices are sized proportionately to their corresponding value When to use a Pie Chart Pie charts are best used when making part-to-whole comparisons. hey have the most impact when the proportion being expressed holds more importance than the specific numbers. They are most clearly understood when using small data sets, often grouping smaller data into an \u201cother\u201d category on the chart. It is recommended tha you use a Pie chart when you\u2019ve got 2-3 data points that are significantly different. This is the one instance when pie charts are helpful \u2012 they\u2019re good at showing people what a fraction of something looks like. Common Misuses Fitting a pie to incompatible data One of the most common mistakes with using a pie chart is to fit it to data that does not represent a parts-to-whole comparison. This confusion occurs most often when the values to be plotted are percentages or proportions, but don\u2019t comprise a complete whole. The example below shows how frequently the people surveyed used each of four applications, but since many people used multiple apps, the proportions sum to much more than 100%. Use Case Examples In this example, the PIE chart was used to represent the data from Percentage of population with knowledge of English and French by census division, 2016 . Configure the Pie Chart To configure this plugin to work with a mapping web service the following parameters are required. Parameters Description General Type Determines the type of chart to be created. This includes pie chart, bar chart or line chart Title Determines the chart title to be displayed Options Colors An option to include hexadecimal color values to use to display the chart Cutout Determines the percentage to cut out when creating the pie chart. This option is only available when creating a pie chart Labels Type Determines the type of label to be used. The label names can be retrieved from a field from the layer (linear or time for line chart) or from configuration Values Determines the label names to be used for the charting tool. Depending on the type chosen you can either enter a field name which contains the label names or if the configuration type is chosen values are listed and separated by a semicolon Split Determines the special character to use to split the labels Layers Id Determines which layer the charting plugin with work with as defined in the layer section. *The plugin, for the moment will only work when there is on layer on the moment Data Determines the different datasets for the layer to use to create the chart Type - Determines the type of value to be expected. There are two options available to choose from; \u201cSingle\u201d or \u201ccombine\u201d. If \u201cSingle\u201d is used it is expected that there is only one value inside the field. If \u201ccombine\u201d is used it is expected that a date and value are part of the field Measure - Determines the field name to be used to create the chart. Note, this must be the field name and not the alias for this to work. Dataset Splitter - Regex expression to split datasets inside the field. this field is to manage when you have multiple datasets or combine values in the same field. To be able to seperate datasets from values a regex expression will be used. It is encouraged to use your data and test your regex expression on an online [site](https://regex101.com/) (e.g. '\\\\[|\\\\];\\\\[|\\\\]' for '[255;255;255];[120;232;23]'. There is 2 different values [];[]). We strongly recommand using a regex validator with your data to test your expression. Value Splitter - character to use to slit values inside a field (e.g. \"val1:val2:val3\" will use : as split character) Dataset Labels Type - Determines the type of value to be expected. There are two options available to choose from; \u201cSingle\u201d or \u201ccombine\u201d. If \u201cSingle\u201d is used it is expected that there is only one value inside the field. If \u201ccombine\u201d is used it is expected that a date and value are part of the field Values - Values seperated by semicolon or field name Split Character - character to use to slit values inside a field (e.g. \"val1:val2:val3\" will use : as split character) Prefix - Determines the prefix to be added to the data hover. Suffix - Determines the suffix to be added to the data hover. Bar Chart Overview Bar charts summarize and compare categorical data by using proportional bar lengths to represent values. The Chart Plugin supports two different types of bar charts. The traditional bar chart as well as grouped bar charts. Bar charts are composed of an x-axis and a y-axis. The x-axis represents discrete categories that correspond to one or many bars. Each bar\u2019s height corresponds to a numeric value, which is measured by the y-axis. A grouped bar chart extends the bar chart, plotting numeric values for levels of two categorical variables instead of one. Bars are grouped by position for levels of one categorical variable, with color indicating the secondary category level within each group Best Pratices Tips for interacting with the Bar Charts Use a common zero-valued baseline First and foremost, make sure that all of your bars are being plotted against a zero-value baseline. Not only does that baseline make it easier for readers to compare bar lengths, it also maintains the truthfulness of your data visualization. A bar chart with a non-zero baseline or some other gap in the axis scale can easily misrepresent the comparison between groups since the ratio in bar lengths will not match the ratio in actual bar values. When attempting to use the barchart to represet multi year data information. It is important to note the data structure which will enable you to accomplish this. In the example below the population for each year is represented as an attribute field. When to use a Bar Chart A bar chart is used when you want to show a distribution of data points or perform a comparison of metric values across different subgroups of your data. From a bar chart, we can see which groups are highest or most common, and how other groups compare against the others. Since this is a fairly common task, bar charts are a fairly ubiquitous chart type. Use Case Examples In this example, Configure the Bar Chart To configure this plugin to work with a mapping web service the following parameters are required. Parameters Description General Type Determines the type of chart to be created. This includes pie chart, bar chart or line chart Title Determines the chart title to be displayed Options Colors An option to include hexadecimal color values to use to display the chart Labels Axis This option is only available when creating the bar and line chart. Type Determines the type of label to be used. The label names can be retrieved from a field from the layer (linear or time for line chart) or from configuration Title Determines the title name to be used for the different axis Values Determines the label names to be used for the charting tool. Depending on the type chosen you can either enter a field name which contains the label names or if the configuration type is chosen values are listed and separated by a semicolon. Split Determines the special character to use to split the labels Layers Id Determines which layer the charting plugin with work with as defined in the layer section. *The plugin, for the moment will only work when there is on layer on the moment Data Determines the different datasets for the layer to use to create the chart Type - Determines the type of value to be expected.

Suffix - Determines the suffix to be added to the data hover. Line Chart Overview A line chart consists of one or more lines connecting successive attribute values. Line graphs are useful for showing how things change or move over time and what the trends in the data may be. Since a line graph uses straight line segments to connect data points, it is easy to determine the data range, minimum and maximum, gaps, clusters, and outliers. When the primary categorical variable is continuous in nature, especially if it deals with time, then a useful alternative chart type to consider is the line chart. A line chart is especially useful when there are a lot of levels in the primary categorical variable: the need to cluster many bars around each position can make the chart difficult to read. The line chart cleans this up by aligning each of the sub-groups vertically, and the connected line between points makes it easier to track how each sub-group changes. Best Practices Tips for interacting with the Line Charts To use the Line chart to its best, data must be formatted in a specific way. When to use a Line Chart Line charts are useful when you want to show the changes in value of a given variable with respect to the changes in some other variable. The other variable is usually time. For example, line charts can be used to show the speed of a vehicle during specific time intervals. Multiple lines can also be plotted in a single line chart to compare the trend between series. A common use case for this is to observe the breakdown of the data across different subgroups.

Pie charts are also not meant to show more than five to eight data points. Doughnut plot The Plugin is capable of using implementing an alternative representation of the common pie chart commonly known as the doughnut plot. A doughnut plot (aka donut plot) is simply a pie chart with a central circle removed. For the most part, there aren\u2019t significant differences in readability between a pie chart and donut chart, so the choice of a doughnut over a standard circle is mostly that of aesthetic.

The basic slider is a horizontal bar and has anchors that can be moved to establish the range of the values to be used. To visualize your data as a dynamic range, you can use any layer that contains numeric or date fields. Once you define the range properties for your layer, an interactive, on-screen slider is used to explore the data through a range/time you customized. Using this plugin, you can control the animation of the data with buttons to play and pause, go to the previous range/time, and go to the next range/time. The Range/Time Slider plugin simplifies the visualization of temporal data in your maps. Before adding the Time Slider to your application, you first should understand how it can be configured to correctly display your temporal data. The plugin properties can be set using any numerical or date field stored in the attribute field. For example, a range of values for a particular parameter. Advantages of the Range/Time Slider What are the advantages of using the Range/Time Slider plugin? The Range/Time Slider plugin offers many advantages to both the data contributor and the user. The main advantage to the data contributor when using the Range/Time Slider plugin is the ability to provide Time Series Animation or Range filtering of the data using only one layer. The advantages the Range/Time Slider provides to the user can be summarized in the following points: The ability to animation a GIF. Granular control over the time increment Lock or unlock the anchors when step or play. Tip Click on the top right corner to activate compact mode Best Practices Get the best out of the Range/Time Slider The Range/Time Slider is best used in cases where you have a mapservice/layer with a numeric / date field. In this regard, you can filter the data using the slider and the results are displayed dynamically on the map. Take, for example, this map layer General distribution of humpback whales in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence dataset. If we look at the map service for this dataset, we can see that there are a few fields that can work with the Range/Time Slider Plugin. In this example, the \u201cYear\u201d field was used. Utilizing the Range/Time Slider together with this rich data, we can dynamically filter the data to narrow results immediately. You can interactively adjust the minimum and maximum values of the displayed range, or move the entire range up and down. The slider and range settings are fully configurable using the Range tab, allowing you to look through the full range extent of your data using logical increments. By pressing the play button, the map will begin a time-series animation based on the range set. This may be 1-year or 5-year increments. This is a useful ability to determine trends or patterns occurring within the dataset. Note Click on the full screen button to enter an expansive view. Use Case Examples Range Slider In this example, the Range/Time Slider plugin was used with the Hydroelectric layer . This layer is an example of an ESRI Feature layer being used with the range slider. The Total_MW field was used with the range slider plugin to give the ability to the viewer to select specific amount of power generation they may be interested in. It is important to note the data structure of this layer. Looking closer at this dataset we can see that the Total_MW field consists of only integers. This enables the range slider to automatically identify the limits of the ranges present. Time Series In this example, the Range/Time Slider was used with the Ocean Data Inventory Temperature and Ocean Data Inventory Salinity datasets. The plugin was used with the \u201cCOLLECTION_START_DATE\u201d it is interesting to note that both layers share the same field in this example. This made it easier to use the Range/Time Slider plugin with both layers simultaneously. Tip Use the anchors on the left and right to set the range of values to be displayed. Configure the Range/Time Slider Plugin The plugin works with the following mapping services: ESRI Feature ESRI Dynamic ESRI WMS ESRI Image OGC WMS OGC WMS-T OGC WCS More information on Web map services can be found here. Getting Started Data Preparation To get started we need to ensure that your data is prepared in a format that will work well with the Range Slider plugin. (i) For time-series animation, the range slider works best with a layer that has a time attribute in the attribute table. For example, this can be simply a year (1980) or a date and time (1/1/1980 12:00:00). (ii) For other use cases, once there is a numeric field present in the attribute table it will work with the Range Slider Configure the Range Slider Step 1. Ensure that the Range/Time Slider Plugin is enabled. Your browser does not support the video tag. There you will find the options to: (i) Start the animation on load \u2013 This will run the animation as soon as the map loads (ii) Play the animation in a loop \u2013 This will by default continue to loop through the animation. Under Slider bar controls, choose whether you want the slider to do the following: Lock/unlock minimal range Loop playback. Export animation as GIF Delay between animation Refresh Step 2. Define parameters (a) Choose the Slider Type Under the Slider Type, select one of the options, Number, Date or WMS-T. This corresponds to the map service type that will be used with the plugin Note When using Esri Image service, you will use the Date type, When using OGC WMS, WMS-T type is selected. When using if Date or WMS-T is selected, the range and limit must be in milliseconds. (b) Chosse the Range Type - Under the Range Type, select one of the options available. The Range/Time slider offers two options. Single and Dual, This relates to how the slider will be represented. Dual means that you have a left and right anchor present. This allows to set a range using both anchors at the same time. On the other hand, single only displays one anchor which is used to set single ranges. (c) Choose the Step Type - Choose one of the ooptions available. The step type determines whether you want to use Dynamic where the ranges are dynamically determined between the maximum and minimum limits or static where you manually input the desired ranges you want the user to be able to use. Note Single range type and Dynamic step type is not allowed (d) Units - Define your units you are working in. This is where the unit of measure is defined to be displayed on the right side of the slider. Please note that is recommended that this be kept short or remain to a symbol. E.g., If your data shows the change in temperature is Celsius degrees; the degree symbol should be considered to be used. (e) Description You have the option to add any extra description you want to communicate to the user. This will be displayed at the bottom of the toolbar. (f) Precision Set the desired precision to be used by the Range Slider. You have the option to either set the number of decimal places when dealing with numerical data or use Date or Hour formats when displaying time specific data. (g) Set the animation delay. The default is 3sec Your browser does not support the video tag. Step 3. Range and Limits Define your range and limits for your data. If you set your Slider Type to (i) Date or (ii)WMS-T, you must define limits using milliseconds as mentioned in Step 1. This step is not necessary if your Slider Type is set to number A conversion tool is built into the Authoring tool to allow for easy conversion between date and times. Extra Step. Step Type as \u201cStatic\u201d Some layer types require extra inputs to be completed before it will load. If you are using the Step Type as \u201cStatic\u201d there will be an extra option available to set the individual steps for the data. You are able to add as many individual values as required. Your browser does not support the video tag. Tip You do not need to set the minimum and maximum values as part of the static limit values. This will be automatically loaded from the default limit values that your defined earlier. Step 4. Under layers, select the layer which the plugin will be enabled on. The layer Id is automatically generated when adding a map service to the Authoring tool. Each layer will have a unique Id generated. Ensure that you are selecting the correct layer to be used. Populate the field name that the Range Slider will use to reference the data. Note The exact field name must be used, not the alias. Definition of Parameters To configure this plugin to work with a mapping web service the following parameters are required. Parameters Description General Open Determines if the plugin will open/load automatically when a layer loads. By default it is set to open on map load Autorun Allows the animation to start automatically when the map loads.

It is important to note the data structure of this layer. Looking closer at this dataset we can see that the Total_MW field consists of only integers. This enables the range slider to automatically identify the limits of the ranges present. Time Series In this example, the Range/Time Slider was used with the Ocean Data Inventory Temperature and Ocean Data Inventory Salinity datasets. The plugin was used with the \u201cCOLLECTION_START_DATE\u201d it is interesting to note that both layers share the same field in this example.

There you will find the options to: (i) Start the animation on load \u2013 This will run the animation as soon as the map loads (ii) Play the animation in a loop \u2013 This will by default continue to loop through the animation. Under Slider bar controls, choose whether you want the slider to do the following: Lock/unlock minimal range Loop playback. Export animation as GIF Delay between animation Refresh Step 2. Define parameters (a) Choose the Slider Type Under the Slider Type, select one of the options, Number, Date or WMS-T. This corresponds to the map service type that will be used with the plugin Note When using Esri Image service, you will use the Date type, When using OGC WMS, WMS-T type is selected. When using if Date or WMS-T is selected, the range and limit must be in milliseconds. (b) Chosse the Range Type - Under the Range Type, select one of the options available. The Range/Time slider offers two options. Single and Dual, This relates to how the slider will be represented. Dual means that you have a left and right anchor present. This allows to set a range using both anchors at the same time. On the other hand, single only displays one anchor which is used to set single ranges. (c) Choose the Step Type - Choose one of the ooptions available. The step type determines whether you want to use Dynamic where the ranges are dynamically determined between the maximum and minimum limits or static where you manually input the desired ranges you want the user to be able to use. Note Single range type and Dynamic step type is not allowed (d) Units - Define your units you are working in. This is where the unit of measure is defined to be displayed on the right side of the slider. Please note that is recommended that this be kept short or remain to a symbol. E.g., If your data shows the change in temperature is Celsius degrees; the degree symbol should be considered to be used. (e) Description You have the option to add any extra description you want to communicate to the user. This will be displayed at the bottom of the toolbar. (f) Precision Set the desired precision to be used by the Range Slider. You have the option to either set the number of decimal places when dealing with numerical data or use Date or Hour formats when displaying time specific data. (g) Set the animation delay. The default is 3sec Your browser does not support the video tag. Step 3. Range and Limits Define your range and limits for your data. If you set your Slider Type to (i) Date or (ii)WMS-T, you must define limits using milliseconds as mentioned in Step 1. This step is not necessary if your Slider Type is set to number A conversion tool is built into the Authoring tool to allow for easy conversion between date and times. Extra Step. Step Type as \u201cStatic\u201d Some layer types require extra inputs to be completed before it will load.

The thematic slider offers one of the simplest ways to display change over time for raster datasets that are not time enabled. At the same time, the plugin can show title and description for each of the layers allowing you to give greater context and meaning. Note A thematic map can also show the spatial distribution of identifiable earth surface features. Themes can range from, for example, categories such as vegetation, soil and surface water. It is implied in the construction of a theme. Advantages of the Thematic Slider What are the advantages of using the Thematic Slider plugin? The Thematic Slider plugin offers many advantages to both the data contributor and the user. If the data contributor has multiple layers each corresponding to a single map for a particular time: The Thematic Slider offers the ability to list all the layers to be displayed in order one after the other. The plugin allows for the ability to automatically cycle through / animate the layers when the map is loaded. If there is an extra context that can further explain/enhance the user experience or provide more information about the layer, the plugin allows for it to be placed. The main advantage to the user is the overall experience of being able to view cumulative change over time with no effort. Having all the layers being pre-organized in order and the extra context provided, the user can quickly make any inferences from the dataset all within a short time. Best Practices Get the best out of the Thematic Slider The Thematic Slider plugin is best used in cases where there are multiple raster layers (static maps) that correspond to a particular time. In this regard, it provides the ability to focus on the change occurring over each time as it cycles through each map. Take, for example, this map service, Fire Season Length under RCP 8.5 . If we look at the available layers corresponding to Fire Season Length under RCP 8.5, we can note that 3 different map layers are representing Short Term (2011-2040) , Medium Term (2041-2070) and Long Term (2071-2100) . If this were to be displayed all together on a single map, some issues may arise such as: When all the layers are enabled, overlapping features will be hidden and it will be difficult to identify any cumulative change. It is easy to disorganize the order of the layers. This is especially true when dealing with large datasets. Integrating the Thematic Slider plugin with this rich dataset allows the ability to cycle through each map layer providing any extra context as needed. The user can quickly navigate between each layer individually as well as the option to cycle through the layer at a predetermined time. Use Case Examples In this example, the Thematic Slider plugin was used to highlight xSO4D wet deposition maps 1981-2015 . This map service has a total of 36 layers each showing the XS04D. The thematic slider provides the ability to load each layer and cycle through them highlighting change over time. This particular map service has a total of 36 layers present. Although using all 36 layers is possible it is not recommended. Loading all 36 maps at the same time results in extra time required for loading. For this use case, the thematic slider was used to show cumulative change for every 10 years between 1981 \u2013 2015. Tip It is recommended to use the thematic slider with no more than 15 layers at a time. Testing has shown that a maximum of 15 layers meets the optimal loading time as recommended by the FGP Data team. If there is a case where there are multiple layers to be used with the thematic slider, you may consider adjusting the time between the layers. For example, if there is a dataset consisting of raster layers spanning from 1990 \u2013 2020, you can consider adding layers after every 10 years.
