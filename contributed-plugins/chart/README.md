# chart
This plugin let you creates a chart from feature attributes when a user click on it. It is based on [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) open source librairy.
It works with ESRI layer dynamic or Feature. It also works with file layer type like CSV or GeoJSON when they are served from a server.

To give an idea, you can have a layer with these 2 fields (data and label). Each feature can have is own set of values an labels like this:
data = 92;43.54;12.3;66;75
label = Red;Green;Blue;Yellow;Orange
These values will create a pie or bar chart with 5 categories (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Orange)

You can have more then one dataset by feature for bar or line chart like this:
data1 = 34;45;65
data2 = 12;54;23
label = First;Second
These values will create a bar chart with 2 categories (First and Second) with 2 sets of values for each. Labels can be part of the layer and this is especially
useful when labaels are different from one feature to another. If they are the same, they can be set inside the configuration for the chart.

You can have a line chart with date as x axis like this:
Measure1 = (2011-03-16,0.01),(2011-03-21,2.49),(2011-03-28,0.54),(2011-04-01,0.16),(2011-04-11,0.14),(2011-04-18,0.05)
Measure2 = (2011-03-21,0.173),(2011-03-28,0.069),(2011-04-01,0.023),(2011-04-11,0.080),(2011-04-18,0.030),(2011-04-26,0.005)
Each couple of values (yyyy-mm-dd,data) is a point on the line chart with the date as the x value and the data as the y value. Thois sample will create a line chart with 2 lines.

You can also have a customized details panel to show useful data. It can take links, images, data from the the feature. It is based on the Markdown notation and uses
[Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) library to parse the markdown from the configuration file to the details panel. To use the value of a field from the feature,
use the field name wrapped inside {{}} (e.g. {{label}}).

            }
        }]
    }
}
```

Configuration parameters
- type: chart type to create (pie, bar or line)
- title: chart title
- axis: object to handle how labels and slider (line) will be generate (xAxis and yAxis). Only for bar and line chart.
  - type: type of labels, from a field or configuration for bar chart or from values (linear or date in yyyy-mm-dd format) for line chart.
  - title: title of the axis
  - values: name field to get the labels (only for type field)
  - split: character to use to split the labels (only for type field)
options: chart options
  - colors: array of hexadecimal color values to use to display the chart
  - cutOut: percentage to cut for the hole in a pie chart
layers: array of layers to use to create chart
  - id: layer id as define in layer section
  - data: array of datasets for this layer to use to create the chart
    - type: "single" if there is only one value inside the field or "combine" if we use date axis and date and value are part of the field
    - measure: field name to use for the measure to create the chart. It must be the field name, not the alias.
    - label: object to customize the label creation
      - type: how to retreive the labels from (field or config)
      - values: config = string of values to use separated by semi colon (e.g "lbl1;lbl2;lbl3") or field = field name
      - split: character to use to split list of values when type = field
    - regex: regex value to split dataset inside the field. (e.g. '\\\\[|\\\\];\\\\[|\\\\]' for '[255;255;255];[120;232;23]'. There is 2 different values [];[]). We strongly recommand using a regex validator with your data to test your expression.
    - split: character to use to slit values inside a field (e.g. "val1:val2:val3" will use : as split character)
    - prefix: string prefix to add to data hover
    - suffix: string suffix to add to data hover
  - details: object to handle details panel customization
    - enabled: boolean to specify if the details panel should be customize for this layer
    - value: string with the custom details in markdown notation
