# Range Slider
This plugin let you add a range slider to your map. The slider works with ESRI feature, EASRI dynamic, ESRI WMS and WMS-T layers. You can use multiple layers at the same time.

[Demo page](https://jolevesq.github.io/contributed-plugins/range-slider/samples/range-slider-index.html)

Note: The export to GIF function is not supported on Internet Explorer as it does not support SVG <foreignObject> tag and Safari, as it uses a stricter security model on <foreignObject> tag (domtoimage library).
