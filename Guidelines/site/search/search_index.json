Bar charts are composed of an x-axis and a y-axis. The x-axis represents discrete categories that correspond to one or many bars. Each bar\u2019s height corresponds to a numeric value, which is measured by the y-axis. A bar chart (aka bar graph, column chart) plots numeric values for levels of a categorical feature as bars. Levels are plotted on one chart axis, and values are plotted on the other axis. Each categorical value claims one bar, and the length of each bar corresponds to the bar\u2019s value. Bars are plotted on a common baseline to allow for easy comparison of values. A grouped bar chart (aka clustered bar chart, multi-series bar chart) extends the bar chart, plotting numeric values for levels of two categorical variables instead of one. Bars are grouped by position for levels of one categorical variable, with color indicating the secondary category level within each group Configure the Bar Chart To configure this plugin to work with a mapping web service the following parameters are requited to be completed. Parameters Description General Type Determines the type of chart to be created. This includes pie chart, bar chart or line chart Title Determines the chart title to be displayed Options Colors An option to include hexadecimal color values to use to display the chart Labels Axis This option is only available when creating the bar and line chart.

Dataset Splitter - Regex expression to split datasets inside the field. this field is to manage when you have multiple datasets or combine values in the same field. To be able to seperate datasets from values a regex expression will be used. It is encouraged to use your data and test your regex expression on an online [site](https://regex101.com/) (e.g. '\\\\[|\\\\];\\\\[|\\\\]' for '[255;255;255];[120;232;23]'.

Best Pratices Tips for interacting with the Bar Charts Use a common zero-valued baseline First and foremost, make sure that all of your bars are being plotted against a zero-value baseline. Not only does that baseline make it easier for readers to compare bar lengths, it also maintains the truthfulness of your data visualization. A bar chart with a non-zero baseline or some other gap in the axis scale can easily misrepresent the comparison between groups since the ratio in bar lengths will not match the ratio in actual bar values. When to use a Bar Chart A bar chart is used when you want to show a distribution of data points or perform a comparison of metric values across different subgroups of your data.

Line graphs are useful for showing how things change or move over time and what the trends in the data may be. Since a line graph uses straight line segments to connect data points, it is easy to determine the data range, minimum and maximum, gaps, clusters, and outliers. When the primary categorical variable is continuous in nature, especially if it deals with time, then a useful alternative chart type to consider is the line chart. A line chart is especially useful when there are a lot of levels in the primary categorical variable: the need to cluster many bars around each position can make the chart difficult to read. The line chart cleans this up by aligning each of the sub-groups vertically, and the connected line between points makes it easier to track how each sub-group changes.

Best Pratices Tips for interacting with the Pie Charts Keep the followin in mind when using a Pie Chart to visualize data: Don\u2019t use more than five sections It is reccomended that around 5 sections is an adequate amount of slices to be used with the pie charts. Too many slices are hard to read. It is easy to overwhelm the user. Make sure all data adds up to 100% Verify that values total 100% and that pie slices are sized proportionately to their corresponding value When to use a Pie Chart Pie charts are best used when making part-to-whole comparisons. hey have the most impact when the proportion being expressed holds more importance than the specific numbers. They are most clearly understood when using small data sets, often grouping smaller data into an \u201cother\u201d category on the chart. It is recommended tha you use a Pie chart when you\u2019ve got 2-3 data points that are significantly different. This is the one instance when pie charts are helpful \u2012 they\u2019re good at showing people what a fraction of something looks like. Common Misuses Fitting a pie to incompatible data One of the most common mistakes with using a pie chart is to fit it to data that does not represent a parts-to-whole comparison. This confusion occurs most often when the values to be plotted are percentages or proportions, but don\u2019t comprise a complete whole.

The basic slider is horizontal and has anchors that can be moved to establish the range of values to be used. To visualize your data as a dynamic range, you can use any layer that contain numeric or date fields. Once you define the range properties for your layer, an interactive, on-screen slider is used to explore the data through a range you customized. The Time Slider plugin enables you to view temporal layers in a map and play the animation to see how the data changes over time. Using this plugin, you can control the animation of the data with buttons to play and pause, go to the previous time period, and go to the next time period. Range Slider properties can be set using any numerical or date field stored in the attribute fields for the following later types. ESRI Feature ESRI Dynamic ESRI WMS OGC WMS OGC WMS-T OGC WCS Configure the Range Slider Plugin To configure this plugin to work with a mapping web service the following parameters are requited to be configured. Parameters Description General Open Determines if the plugin will open/load automatically when a layer loads. By default it is set to open on map load Slide Bar Controls Lock Lock or unlock left anchor when step or play Loop Loop the animation Delay Add a dropdown menu to change the delay in play animation Export Ability to export the animation to a GIF Refresh Reset the slider with the default values Params Type Determines the type of slider (date or number) to be used. If date is selected, range and limit must be in milliseconds. Units Determines the units label to add the right of the slider bar. Description This allows for a description to be added to the slider information section. By default, the layer name and field will be included. Delay Sets the delay between animations in milliseconds Range Determines the minimum and maximum range values to be used in the plugin Minimum - Set the minimum value for the range slider. If this is not set the minimum range will be determined from the field selected. Maximum \u2013 Set the maximum value for the range slider. If this is not set the maximum range will be used Limit Determines the minimum and maximum limit values to be used in the plugin Minimum - Set the minimum value for the range slider. If this is not set the minimum range will be determined from the field selected. Maximum \u2013 Set the maximum value for the range slider. If this is not set the maximum range will be used Layers Id Determines the layer id as defined in the layer section. Field Determines the field name of the field to be used to filter with the range slider. It is important to note that the field name has to be used and not the alias of the field. Best Pratices Once you have defined a range for a layer, the range slider appears as an on-screen control along the side of your map or scene. You can interactively adjust the minimum and maximum values of the displayed range, or move the entire range up and down. The slider and range settings are fully configurable using the Range tab, allowing you to look through the full range extent of your data using logical increments. You can view the range slider either as a full extent slider. The Time Slider plugin enables you to view temporal layers in a map and play the animation to see how the data changes over time. Using this plugin, you can control the animation of the data with buttons to play and pause, go to the previous time period, and go to the next time period. Use Case Examples For example the Range Slider plugin was used with the Permafrost by ecoprovince layer. The PERMAFROST_PERCENT was used with the range slider plugin to give the ability to the viewer to select specific percentages of permafrost they may be interested in.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"rangetimeslider/#range-slider-time-slider","text":"This plugin allows you add a range slider to your map. The basic slider is horizontal and has anchors that can be moved to establish the range of values to be used. To visualize your data as a dynamic range, you can use any layer that contain numeric or date fields. Once you define the range properties for your layer, an interactive, on-screen slider is used to explore the data through a range you customized. The Time Slider plugin enables you to view temporal layers in a map and play the animation to see how the data changes over time. Using this plugin, you can control the animation of the data with buttons to play and pause, go to the previous time period, and go to the next time period.

It provides horizontal and vertical view modes. You can slide the swipe tool to reveal the content of another layer. The plugin works with the following mapping services: ESRI Feature ESRI Dynamic ESRI Image OGC WMS OGC WFS OGC WCS Configure the Swiper Plugin To configure this plugin to work with a mapping web service the following parameters are requited to be configured. Parameters Description General Type Determines of the swiper is vertical or horizontal. Note: Only vertical is supported at the moment Keyboard Offset Determines the number of pixels to move the swiper when the keyboard is used for navigation Layers Id Layer id as defined in layer section Best Pratices The Swiper plugin is a visualization enhancer used to compare different layers. For example, you may want to use it to show before-and-after imagery of a flood, or display two related thematic layers in a map. You have the capability to move the slider back and forth to see the changes. The recommended way to utilize this plugin effectively is as a comparative tool. You can use the swiper plugin to compare layers for an extra layer of visual analysis. As you swipe, the enabled layer will be temporarily erased relative to the position of the swiper. It is important to note that when using the swiper tool with two different layers, the layer with the swiper tool enabled can obscure the underlying layer. The tool could be used to explore satellite or aerial images of locations before and after disasters such as wildfires or landslides. You can also use this tool to compare historical and current maps to see how change occurs over time Use Case Example For example, the swiper tool was used to show the changes in land cover for Agricultural Regions for Canada between 1995 and 2000.
