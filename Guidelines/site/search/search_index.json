The Chart Plugin supports two different types of bar charts. The traditional bar chart as well as grouped bar charts. Bar charts are composed of an x-axis and a y-axis. The x-axis represents discrete categories that correspond to one or many bars. Each bar\u2019s height corresponds to a numeric value, which is measured by the y-axis. A grouped bar chart extends the bar chart, plotting numeric values for levels of two categorical variables instead of one. Bars are grouped by position for levels of one categorical variable, with color indicating the secondary category level within each group Best Pratices Tips for interacting with the Bar Charts Use a common zero-valued baseline First and foremost, make sure that all of your bars are being plotted against a zero-value baseline. Not only does that baseline make it easier for readers to compare bar lengths, it also maintains the truthfulness of your data visualization. A bar chart with a non-zero baseline or some other gap in the axis scale can easily misrepresent the comparison between groups since the ratio in bar lengths will not match the ratio in actual bar values. When attempting to use the barchart to represet multi year data information. It is important to note the data structure which will enable you to accomplish this. In the example below the population for each year is represented as an attribute field.

Best Practices Tips for interacting with the Pie Charts Keep the followin in mind when using a Pie Chart to visualize data: Don\u2019t use more than five sections It is reccomended that around 5 sections is an adequate amount of slices to be used with the pie charts. Too many slices are hard to read. It is easy to overwhelm the user. Make sure all data adds up to 100% Verify that values total 100% and that pie slices are sized proportionately to their corresponding value When to use a Pie Chart Pie charts are best used when making part-to-whole comparisons. hey have the most impact when the proportion being expressed holds more importance than the specific numbers. They are most clearly understood when using small data sets, often grouping smaller data into an \u201cother\u201d category on the chart. It is recommended tha you use a Pie chart when you\u2019ve got 2-3 data points that are significantly different. This is the one instance when pie charts are helpful \u2012 they\u2019re good at showing people what a fraction of something looks like. Common Misuses Fitting a pie to incompatible data One of the most common mistakes with using a pie chart is to fit it to data that does not represent a parts-to-whole comparison. This confusion occurs most often when the values to be plotted are percentages or proportions, but don\u2019t comprise a complete whole. The example below shows how frequently the people surveyed used each of four applications, but since many people used multiple apps, the proportions sum to much more than 100%.

This is the one instance when pie charts are helpful \u2012 they\u2019re good at showing people what a fraction of something looks like. Common Misuses Fitting a pie to incompatible data One of the most common mistakes with using a pie chart is to fit it to data that does not represent a parts-to-whole comparison. This confusion occurs most often when the values to be plotted are percentages or proportions, but don\u2019t comprise a complete whole. The example below shows how frequently the people surveyed used each of four applications, but since many people used multiple apps, the proportions sum to much more than 100%.","title":"Best Practices"},{"location":"chart/pie/chart_pie/#use-case-examples","text":"In this example, the PIE chart was used to represent the data from Percentage of population with knowledge of English and French by census division, 2016 .","title":"Use Case Examples"},{"location":"chart/pie/configuration/","text":"","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"chart/pie/use_cases/","text":"","title":"Use cases"},{"location":"rangetimeslider/configuration/","text":"Configure the Range/Time Slider Plugin The plugin works with the following mapping services: ESRI Feature ESRI Dynamic ESRI WMS ESRI Image OGC WMS OGC WMS-T OGC WCS More information on Web map services can be found here.

The Range/Time Slider offers a dynamic way to visualize your data. The basic slider is a horizontal bar and has anchors that can be moved to establish the range of the values to be used. To visualize your data as a dynamic range, you can use any layer that contains numeric or date fields. Once you define the range properties for your layer, an interactive, on-screen slider is used to explore the data through a range/time you customized. Using this plugin, you can control the animation of the data with buttons to play and pause, go to the previous range/time, and go to the next range/time. Range Slider Range Slider properties can be set using any numerical or date field stored in the attribute field. For example, a range of values for a particular parameter. Time Slider The Time Slider plugin simplifies the visualization of temporal data in your maps. Before adding the Time Slider to your application, you first should understand how it can be configured to correctly display your temporal data. Advantages of the Range/Time Slider What are the advantages of using the Range/Time Slider plugin? The Range/Time Slider plugin offers many advantages to both the data contributor and the user. The main advantage to the data contributor when using the Range/Time Slider plugin is the ability to provide Time Series Animation or Range filtering of the data using only one layer. The advantages the Range/Time Slider provides to the user can be summarized in the following points: The ability to animation a GIF. Granular control over the time increment Lock or unlock the anchors when step or play. Best Pratices Get the best out of the Range/Time Slider The Range/Time Slider is best used in cases where you have a single layer with a numeric / date field. In this regard, you can filter the data using the slider and the results are displayed dynamically on the map. Take, for example, this map layer General distribution of humpback whales in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence dataset. If we look at the map service for this dataset, we can see that there are a few fields that can work with the Range/Time Slider Plugin. In this example, the \u201cYear\u201d field was used. Utilizing the Range/Time Slider together with this rich data, we can dynamically filter the data to narrow results immediately. You can interactively adjust the minimum and maximum values of the displayed range, or move the entire range up and down. The slider and range settings are fully configurable using the Range tab, allowing you to look through the full range extent of your data using logical increments. By pressing the play button, the map will begin a time-series animation based on the range set. This may be 1-year or 5-year increments. This is a useful ability to determine trends or patterns occurring within the dataset.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"rangetimeslider/overview/#range-slidertime-slider","text":"What is the Range/Time Slider?

The Thematic Slider plugin provides a way to quickly visualize a theme as it loops through an array of layers to highlight accumulations or evolution of geolocation data. The thematic slider offers one of the simplest ways to display change over time for raster datasets that are not time enabled. At the same time, the plugin can show title and description for each of the layers allowing you to give greater context and meaning. Note A thematic map can also show the spatial distribution of identifiable earth surface features. Themes can range from, for example, categories such as vegetation, soil and surface water. It is implied in the construction of a theme. Advantages of the Thematic Slider What are the advantages of using the Thematic Slider plugin? The Thematic Slider plugin offers many advantages to both the data contributor and the user. If the data contributor has multiple layers each corresponding to a single map for a particular time: The Thematic Slider offers the ability to list all the layers to be displayed in order one after the other. The plugin allows for the ability to automatically cycle through / animate the layers when the map is loaded. If there is an extra context that can further explain/enhance the user experience or provide more information about the layer, the plugin allows for it to be placed. The main advantage to the user is the overall experience of being able to view cumulative change over time with no effort.

If this were to be displayed all together on a single map, some issues may arise such as: When all the layers are enabled, overlapping features will be hidden and it will be difficult to identify any cumulative change. It is easy to disorganize the order of the layers. This is especially true when dealing with large datasets.
