# Just Swipe!!

Using the swiper plugin, you are able to view relationships between layers or see what is underneath a layer with a simple swipe.
The swiper plugin can be utilized in just a few quick steps so you can start comparing layers.

## Swipe to compare layers

The most ideal use case for the Swiper plugin is to compare two (or more) layers. This can be useful to view before and after imagery or to view similarities and differences between datasets in the same area. To create a comparison between layers, the layers are both added to the map and the comparison layer is identified. A seamless comparison awaits.

## Swipe to reveal an underlying layer

Another way to utilize this plugin is to see what is underneath a layer. Imagine having multiple layers loaded on a map. It is very difficult to see what is the underlying features when layers are overlapping one another. You could set the opacity of some of the layers but this leaves a very muddled interpretation for analysis.
Consider the Swiper plugin, users can easily swipe to see the underlying datasets for quick analysis.
