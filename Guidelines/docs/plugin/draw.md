# Overview

The Draw Toolbar allows you to interact directly with the map. Functionally, it gives you the ability to create new geometries by drawing them on the map.
The Drawing toolbar contains a collection of icon buttons that allows the user to draw shapes and images in the document.

**Feature Highlight**

Some of the features that the Draw Toolbar provides:

- Draw Points / Lines / Polygons
- Edit / Erase created objects
- Save / Upload Drawing
- Includes distance to your lines, perimeter and area to your polygons.
