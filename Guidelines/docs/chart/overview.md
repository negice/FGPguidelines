# Charts Plugin

The Chart plugin provides extra visualization options for the analysis of data rich datasets. The plugin provides three primary options for dynamic data visualization each with different customizations available.
You can also have a customized details panel to show useful data. It can take links, images and data from the feature. It is based on the Markdown notation and uses Showdown library to parse the markdown from the configuration file to the details panel.

The charting options are:

1. [Pie Chart](./pie/chart_pie.md)
2. [Bar Chart](./bar/chart_bar.md)
3. [Line Chart](./line/chart_line.md)

Data rich datasets can be overwhelming to view in the standard table view. Having a clean and concise way to communicate the data allows for more interactivity with users. Charts give the ability to do just that, however, each chart is used for specific circumstances to ensure a straightforward and clean representation.

The plugin works with the following mapping services:

- ESRI Feature
- ESRI Dynamic
