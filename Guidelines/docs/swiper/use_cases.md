**Example 1**

In this example, the swiper plugin was used to highlight the changes in land cover for Agricultural Regions for Canada between 1995 and [2000](https://gcgeo.gc.ca/geonetwork/metadata/eng/16d2f828-96bb-468d-9b7d-1307c81e17b8). These layers are examples of ESRI Image layer being used with the swiper plugin.

**Example 2**

In this example, the swiper plugin was used to highlight the changes in land cover of Canada between 2010 and [2015](https://gcgeo.gc.ca/geonetwork/metadata/eng/4e615eae-b90c-420b-adee-2ca35896caf6).

It is important to note that in this example, the two land cover layers are very similiar. However, they are subtle difference which can be easily identified while using the Swiper plugin.
